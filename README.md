# 🐦 Flappy Bird Game (Python + Pygame)

Welcome to my custom **Flappy Bird** game — a personal learning project built using **Python** and **Pygame**. This game helped me explore core Python programming concepts along with introductory **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in a fun and interactive way.
